# Discord-Twitchbot

## Intentions

This bot is intended to run on a local channel and track when streamers go online. It will bark into a channel called
"twitchbot" in our discord guild. It's kind of a mess and still a little buggy but it's largely functional.

## Required global packages

This project requires the following system packages (deb, rpm):

* SQL database

This project requires the following npm packages:

* gulp-cli
* db-migrate
